About me:
As a Business Analyst with experience in the HRM and CRM domains, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to enhance business processes and implement system solutions. My work includes developing HR systems and automating workflows using Base.vn and HubSpot. Currently, my short-term goal is to gain the ACCA certification to deepen my finance expertise. My long-term goal is to  leverage my analytical skills and domain knowledge as a Business Analyst in the ERP field.
